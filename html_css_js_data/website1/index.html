                    Hopelessness overwhelms us. The agony of losing our footing causes us to stumble. We make foolish loony decisions.
                    
                    When we focus on the waiting time instead of our desired outcome, we open ourself to desperation’s moves. Then we make impulsive decisions. Unwise irresponsible choices unhinge us from reality.
                    
                    This is what happened to the Israelites after 40 days of not seeing their leader. Discouragement drove them into wilderness wanderings for years.
                    
                    When the people saw how long it was taking Moses to come back down the mountain, they gathered around Aaron. “Come on,” they said, “make us some gods who can lead us. We don’t know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt.” So Aaron said, “Take the gold rings from the ears of your wives and sons and daughters, and bring them to me.” All the people took the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron. Then Aaron took the gold, melted it down, and molded it into the shape of a calf. When the people saw it, they exclaimed, “O Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!” Exodus 32:1–3
                    
                    How do you know you are on ‘desperation’s path’? Some warning signs denoting you have taken the wrong route.
                    Hopelessness defines you.
                    You grieve over past decisions.
                    Negative talk dominates your conversations.
                    Impatient, your desire to do anything rather than wait.
                    Irritation leads to angry cries; please notice me!
                    You discount the positive steps you have had in life.
                    I could go on and on depicting the caution signs along desperation’s path. The fact is this. Ignoring these signs lead to ruin.
                    
                    Inspiration’s sure-footed path lifts our spirit propelling onward towards greatness!
